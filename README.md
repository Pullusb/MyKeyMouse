### Description
  
Add '*view selection*' and '*view all*' shortcuts on mouse.
  
Keymapp a list of shortcut for almost all editor where:
- *mouse button 4* (often used as 'previous' action) is used to "get back", fit all elements in view. (like *home* button)
- *mouse button 5* (often used as 'next' action) is used to "go to", focus on selected items. (like *numpad period* button)

In the addons preferences you can choose to invert (button 4 to focus and button 5 to view all) :

It does NOT affect any original shortcut on keyboard.
<br/>
Usual location of button 4 and 5 on a mouse with basic extra buttons (this may vary a lot on different device)

### Why ?
The location of *home* key and *numpad period* are far from both hands and force you to quit temporarily your rest positions, tending to break the workflow fluidity.
<br/>

### Other added keymaps

- *Ctrl + mouse button 5* Toggle isolate selection (*numpad slash* button)
<br/>

- *Shift + mouse button 4* Snap 3D cursor to selection  
- *Shift + mouse button 5* Snap selection to 3D cursor  
<br/>

- *Alt + mouse button 4* Jump to previous keyframe  
- *Alt + mouse button 5* Jump to next keyframe  
<br/>

- *Alt + Shift + mouse button 4* Jump to previous Marker  
- *Alt + Shift + mouse button 5* Jump to next Marker  
<br/>

- *Ctrl + Shift + alt + mouse mouse button 4* Origin to geometry
- *Ctrl + Shift + alt + mouse mouse button 5* Origin to cursor
<br/>

<!--
- *Ctrl + mouse button 4* Recenter the view on mouse cursor (like "Alt+F"), can be inverted in addon prefs  
- *Ctrl + mouse button 5* Toggle isolate selection (*numpad slash* button), can be inverted in addon prefs
